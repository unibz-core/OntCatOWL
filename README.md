## Software Requirements

You need to [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for executing **OntCatOWL**. The code was
developed and tested using [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.11.0

The following external libraries are necessary:

- [RDFLib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) - version ~= 6.2.0
- [OWL-RL](https://pypi.org/project/owlrl/) - version ~= 6.0.2
- [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) - version ~= 6.0
- [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/) - version ~= 3.4.1

For installing them, run the following command on the terminal:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you would like to use the project as package, run the following command on the terminal:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/unibz-core/OntCatOWL.git
```

## Code Execution

After the external libraries are installed, run the following command on the terminal for executing **OntCatOWL**:

```shell
python ontcatowl.py <input file OR URL>
```

## Usage

```
usage: OntCatOWL [-h] [-i | -a] [-n | -c] [-r] [-t] [-g] [-v] ontology_file

positional arguments:
  ontology_file      The path of the ontology file to be loaded.

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i, --interactive  Executes automatic rules whenever possible. Executes interactive rules only if necessary.
  -a, --automatic    Executes only automatic rules. Interactive rules are not performed.
  -n, --incomplete   The loaded ontology is an incomplete model.
  -c, --complete     The loaded ontology is a complete model.
  -r, --reasoning    Enable RDF reasoning for graph expansion.
  -t, --times        Prints the execution times of all functions.
  -g, --gufo         Imports GUFO ontology in the output ontology file.
  -v, --version      Prints the software version and exit.
```

The input file syntax is automatically detected by the **OntCatOWL**.

## Software Functioning

### Rules Premises

- new classes cannot be created during the execution of OntCatOWL.
- all stereotypes already set as is or not are immutable. i e., there can be no movement from lists is or not.
- When interactivity is enabled, interactions are only available when there are more than one option.

## Software Limitations

### Version X (to be completed)

- Disjoint and Complete are not supported.

## Release Notes

### Release 1
